## Learning Approach

This workshop is **hands-on and practical**:

### We Learn By Doing
- ❌ Not just lectures and slides
- ✅ Real coding exercises
- ✅ Building actual applications
- ✅ Immediate feedback

### Progressive Learning
```
Simple concepts → Practice → Build on previous knowledge → More practice → Complete application
```

### Support System
1. **Try it yourself** first
2. **Discuss with neighbors** if stuck
3. **Raise your hand** for instructor help
4. **Review materials** in the documentation

## Ground Rules

### For the Best Learning Experience

1. **Ask Questions**
   - There are no stupid questions
   - If you're confused, others probably are too
   - Asking helps everyone learn

2. **Help Each Other**
   - Discuss with your neighbors
   - Share solutions and ideas
   - Teaching others reinforces your learning

3. **Focus on Understanding**
   - Don't rush to finish first
   - It's okay to be slower if you understand better
   - Depth over speed

4. **Have Fun!**
   - Programming is creative
   - Building things is satisfying
   - Enjoy the process
